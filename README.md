A Python signal processing package for computing spectral-domain and
time-domain interactions using bispectra.

This package provides the tools for performing spectral- and time-domain
analyses based on bispectra, including phase-amplitude coupling, time delay
estimation, and wave shape features. Additional tools for computing phase-phase
coupling, generalised eigendecompositions, Fourier coefficients, and plotting
results are also provided.

Parallel processing and [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) optimisation are
implemented to reduce computation times. There is a minor reliance on the
[MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) signal processing toolbox.

## Installation & Requirements:
Install the package into the desired environment using pip `pip install pybispectra`<br/>
[See here for the list of requirements](requirements.txt).

## Use:
To get started with the toolbox, check out the [documentation](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [examples](https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).
