============================
Compute phase-phase coupling
============================

This example demonstrates how phase-phase coupling (PPC) can be computed with
PyBispectra.

Background
----------

PPC quantifies the relationship between the phases of a lower frequency
:math:`f_1` and a higher frequency :math:`f_2` within a single signal, or
across different signals.

The method available in PyBispectra can be thought of as a measure of
coherence between frequencies :footcite:`Giehl2021` (note that it is not
based on bispectra):

:math:`\large PPC(x_{f_1}, y_{f_2})=\LARGE \frac{|\langle A_x(f_1)A_y(f_2) e^{i(\varphi_x(f_1)\frac{f_2}{f_1}-\varphi_x(f_2))} \rangle|}{\langle A_x(f_1)A_y(f_2) \rangle}`,

where :math:`A(f)` and :math:`\varphi(f)` are the amplitude and phase of a
signal at a given frequency, respectively, and the angled brackets represent
the average over epochs. The phase of :math:`f_1` is accelerated to match
that of :math:`f_2` by scaling the phase by a factor of
:math:`\frac{f_2}{f_1}`. PPC values for this measure lie in the range
:math:`[0, 1]`, with 0 representing a random phase relationship, and 1
representing perfect phase coupling.
